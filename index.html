		<h3><u> About Aeiral Spraying </u></h3>
        <p>
                Timber is possible the largest industry for Oregon, producing around 3.9 million feet of wooden board in 2017. Just like any other produce, timber has been heavily controlled to maximize yield and production. A common practice to increasing yield is the use of herbicides to prevent other plants and bugs from affecting production. Most of Oregon's timber covers vast areas, that tend to be in rough terrain or are far from large cities. This leads to aerial spraying being the cheapest and most effective way for the timber industy to manage pesticides. The main issue the we bring up is that some of the aeiral spraying is being conducted in State Forests. The intended use of State Forests is for education, recreation, and wildlife habitat, which is what they are protected for. However the aerial spraying from the timber organizations is posing a risk to these State Forests. The map above shows the extent of State Forests in Oregon, the location of Oregon's primary waterways, and the aerial sprayings occuring in them. The biggest issue with aeiral spraying is that the chemicals can easily be spread by the wind, in turn this means that the effected areas have the potential to be larger than the recorded, and can effect towns that are near the cites. 
        </p>

		<h3><u> The Chemicals  </u></h3>
        <p>
			
		</p>
        While the chemicals are designed to be non/slighly toxic, tests have proven that many of the chemicals can be harmful to certain groups, including humans. The large biome that is Oregon's State Forets is quite complex, so the full and true impact that the chemcials have on wildlife cannot be guaranteed. Below you'll find a table with information on all of the chemcials that are known to be used in aerial spraying, and links to more information about each chemical.

        <h3><u>How Can You Help?</u></h3>
        <p>
        Start by visiting the Beyond Toxics website to learn more about them and their mission to create an Oregon that is free of toxic chemicals. Spread the word! The more people that know about a public issue, the more traction it gains. Inform your local lawmakers, true progress comes from law and policy change, this is ultimatly the best option for protecting our State Forests.

		<h3><u> About The Map And Its Creators </u></h3>
        <p>
        	This project was a collaborative effort from a group of students at the University of Oregon. The project was put together to help support efforts by  the environmental group, Beyond Toxics, to regulate aerial herbicide spraying in Oregon State Forests. Beyond Toxics is a non-profit group based out of Eugene Oregon, who spearheaded this legislative effort and aided in this project’s development. We conducted this project for credit within the Geospatial Project Design course in the Department of Geography at the University of Oregon, and were supervised by Professor Carolyn Fish. All spatial data was gathered from the Oregon Department of Forestry’s FERN database and the Oregon Spatial Data Library. Our group represents a diverse range of perspectives, with backgrounds in Geography, Spatial Data Science, Economics, Computer Science, Planning, Public Policy, and Management, and Environmental Science.
